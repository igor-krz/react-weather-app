Good effort on this one - a good user experience and a functioning app! Well done! 

A few points to note:
* No testing at all
* Folder structure needs addressing, should be organised into at minimum a `/components` folder
* state and functions are functional, but a little fragmented, could it all be moved to the middle rather then sitting at the top and bottom of the application? Would this change your implementation? Just something to consider.
